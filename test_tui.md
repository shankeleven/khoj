# Test File for TUI

This is a test file for testing the TUI search functionality.

## Features
- Content search using TF-IDF
- Preview with highlighted terms
- Smooth user interface

## Testing
We can search for words like "search", "preview", or "TUI" to see if highlighting works correctly.

The system should find these keywords and show them with → ← markers around the matching terms.
